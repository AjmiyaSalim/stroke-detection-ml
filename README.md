#  Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning

This is a beginner-friendly machine learning project aimed at predicting the likelihood of a person having a **stroke** based on various health and demographic features. The project uses multiple ML algorithms like **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**, **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**, and **Naive Bayes** for classification and comparison.

## ‚úÖ Conclusion

This project highlights the challenges and importance of dealing with **imbalanced healthcare datasets**. Despite imbalance, machine learning models like **SVM with class balancing** and **Naive Bayes** showed reasonable predictive power. Visualization helped identify key features associated with stroke in different gender groups. The project underlines the real-world applicability of ML in healthcare diagnostics.
